## Introduction

The objective of this project is to perform linear regression model to the experimental data of "Gravitational acceleration" , an eraser falling from different heights. The height and the time taken for the eraser to fall are recorded, and a linear model is used to estimate the relationship between the square of the fall time and the height.

## Dataset

The dataset (`Gravitytest.csv`) contains the following columns:
- `Distance`: The height from which the eraser is dropped (in centimeters).
- `Time`: The time it takes for the eraser to fall (in seconds).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
