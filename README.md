## Introduction

The objective of this project is to perform linear regression model to the experimental data of "Gravitational acceleration" , an eraser falling from different heights. The height and the time taken for the eraser to fall are recorded, and a linear model is used to estimate the relationship between the square of the fall time and the height.

## Dataset

The dataset (`Gravitytest.csv`) contains the following columns:
- `Distance`: The height from which the eraser is dropped (in centimeters).
- `Time`: The time it takes for the eraser to fall (in seconds).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
## Result
-Various evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared value are calculated.
-The script generates plots showing the original data, the fitted line, residuals, and predictions for new fall times.
